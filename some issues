hey dude,i've been looking for your email but none.
here is the thing,i've been learning your article where
url=http://www.plan0213.com/blog/20151202_1/#vnc-server%E3%81%AE%E3%83%91%E3%82%B9%E3%83%AF%E3%83%BC%E3%83%89%E8%A8%AD%E5%AE%9A.
and i'm really confused when i use 'systemctl enable vncserver@:1',
and shell shows 'Failed to execute operation: Too many levels of symbolic links'.
i find out it's due to 'ln -s /lib/systemd/system/vncserver@.service vncserver@:1.service ',
but i don't how to solve it.
could you check this on your os if it's convinient,
mine running on CentOS 7.4 64
and your article really helps me.
